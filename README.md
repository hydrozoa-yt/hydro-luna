Some of the sweetness within Luna
- high performing and scalable <b>where it matters most</b>
- flexible, event-based Kotlin plugin system for game content
- highly documented
- fully featured

Compared to its parent, this project has no major features or improvements. It does contain some npc spawns and dialogue that isn't found in the parent though. 

When features are developed and mature they are added as pull requests to the parent.

# Getting started
Luna is currently unstable and therefore not ready to be used in a production environment. The first stable pre-release will be v0.5.

An official client can be found [here](https://github.com/luna-rs/luna-client), and the cache can be found in the releases section on that page. To learn more about how to get started with Luna please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/luna-rs/luna/wiki).
