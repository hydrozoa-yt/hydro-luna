/**
 * Finds the walk edges that connect the nodes of the web-walker graph.
 *
 * Every node is linked to the nodes nearest to it by the walk, the ones that take the fewest game ticks to walk to. A node
 * that is already linked to another one, from either side, counts towards the nodes that it is linked to. It is not linked
 * to a node if that only makes a second link of a walk
 * that is already linked. That is when a node beside one of the two (a short walk away, and not through a door, as the
 * pathfinder finds it) is linked to a node beside the other. This leaves one link between the two leaves of a double door or a gate and whatever
 * they are linked to, whatever kind of node that is, rather than one for each leaf. The nodes that are left in groups that
 * are not linked to each other are then joined, nearest first, over longer distances. Once it is done, any two nodes that
 * can be walked between are connected, however far apart they are.
 *
 * The linker only asks how far it is to walk between two positions, so it does not depend on any pathfinder.
 *
 * @param pathCost Gives the cost, in game ticks, of walking between two positions on the same plane, or `null` if it can't
 * be walked. This may be called from any thread, but the linker never calls it from more than one at once.
 * @param neighbours How many nodes each node is linked to at first, which includes the ones that are linked to it. A node
 * that other nodes pick can end up with more links than this.
 * @param nearRadius How far, in tiles, the nodes that are linked at first may be.
 * @param farRadius How far, in tiles, nodes in other groups are looked for when joining the groups.
 * @param joinAttempts How many times a pair of groups is tried before giving up on joining them.
 * @param doors The doors of the graph. The tiles on either side of one are already connected by the door, so they are not
 * linked by a walk, which would only be a way around the door. They count as linked for the nodes that they are.
 * @param besideTicks The longest walk, in game ticks, between two nodes for one to be beside the other. A ladder or a
 * trapdoor in the way makes the walk a few ticks, but a wall makes it many more.
 * @param besideRadius How far, in tiles, a node that is beside another one may be. The walk between them is what decides.
