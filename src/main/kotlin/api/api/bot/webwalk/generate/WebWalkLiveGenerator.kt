/**
 * Makes the generated files of the web-walker: `obstacles.jsonc`, `climbs.jsonc`, `teleports.jsonc` and `walk_graph.jsonc`. Everything is made in a
 * single run of the server, by the `generateWebWalk` Gradle task, because most of it needs a running world. The files start
 * with a comment that says they are generated and when, see [WebWalkWriter.header].
 *
 * - The closed doors, gates and curtains of `obstacles.jsonc` are made by [WebWalkDoorGenerator] from the map data of the
 *   cache.
 * - The ladders, stairs and trapdoors of `climbs.jsonc` land where [LadderDestination], [StairDestination] and
 *   [Trapdoor] say that they do, which is what players get.
 * - The teleports of `teleports.jsonc` are the teleport spells, the destinations of the teleport jewellery, and the home
 *   teleport, so that they are never written out by hand.
 * - The waypoints of `walk_graph.jsonc` are made from the zones, their banks and the sub-zones, moved onto a tile that can be stood
 *   on.
 * - The walk edges of `walk_graph.jsonc` link every node of the graph (the ones from the files that are not generated here too)
 *   with the cost of walking between them, according to the collision of the world.
 *
 * It runs in two steps. [gather] needs the game thread, because it reads the world as it is. [finish] only reads the
 * collision snapshots, so it runs on a thread of its own, as it takes a while.
