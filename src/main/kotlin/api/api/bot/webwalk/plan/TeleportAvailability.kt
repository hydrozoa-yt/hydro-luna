/**
 * Finds the teleports that a bot can use right now.
 *
 * It follows the rules of the game without using the game's own checks, which tell the player off when they fail. In
 * short, a bot can use:
 *
 * - a teleport spell if it is on the right spellbook and has the level and what the spell needs. What the spell needs is
 *   its runes (a staff stands in for the runes it represents) and other items in the inventory, and equipment. Combination
 *   runes are not counted, so a bot that only has those is thought unable to cast, which is the safe way to be wrong. The
 *   requirements are enforced in development mode too, although the game itself lets anyone cast anything for free there,
 *   so that bots plan the way they would on a real server.
 * - a teleport by jewellery if it carries a piece with a charge left, in its inventory or equipped.
 * - the home teleport always.
 *
 * Nothing can be used while teleblocked. Where a teleport can be used from, such as not deep in the wilderness, is the
 * requirements of its definition, which the planner checks.
