/**
 * How much the planner dislikes things, as numbers of ticks. The weights are tuned by hand, so they are all here.
 *
 * Most edges already say how long they take, in ticks while running. What is added to that, to steer bots away from things
 * that they would rather not do, are penalties.
 *
 * @property doorTicks The time to open a door, gate or curtain and step through, if the edge doesn't say.
 * @property ladderTicks The time to climb a ladder or staircase, if the edge doesn't say.
 * @property trapdoorTicks The time to open a trapdoor and climb down, if the edge doesn't say.
 * @property crossingTicks The time of a crossing that has a handler, such as a toll gate, if the edge doesn't say.
 * @property shipTicks The time of a ship trip, if the edge doesn't say.
 * @property fairyRingTicks The time of a fairy ring trip.
 * @property coinWeight The penalty for each coin that an edge needs, so that bots don't pay fares and tolls for short trips.
 * Coins are spent, so one coin is worth this many ticks: a toll of 10 coins is worth walking about 10 ticks to avoid.
 * @property runePenalty The penalty for casting a teleport spell, for its runes.
 * @property chargePenalty The penalty for using the charge of teleport jewellery.
 * @property wildernessEntry The penalty for walking into the wilderness, or arriving in it.
 * @property wildernessWalkFactor The penalty for each tick walked in the wilderness, as a multiple of those ticks.
 * @property wildernessLevelScale How much each level of the wilderness adds to that multiple, as a fraction of it.
 * @property linkRadius How far, in tiles, nodes are looked for to link the start and the destination to. This is the range
 * of the route pathfinder, so that the estimates are made without the long range search.
 * @property linkCandidates How many of the nearest nodes are tried to link the start and the destination to.
 * @property alternatives How many other trips are tried to vary the route of a bot.
 * @property jitter How much the cost of each edge may be changed, as a fraction, when trying other trips.
 * @property toleranceFraction How much more than the best trip a bot may take, as a fraction, at the lowest intelligence.
 * @property toleranceMinimum The least ticks that a bot may take more than the best trip, at the lowest intelligence.
 * @property legPenalty A tiny cost for each leg that is only used to choose between trips that cost the same, so that the one
 * with fewer legs wins. It is not part of the cost that a trip is reported to have.
